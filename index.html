    <p>I saw the part of you that only when you're older you will see too<br>
      You will see too<br>
      I held the better cards<br>
      But every stroke of luck has got a bleed through<br>
      It's got a bleed through<br>
      You held the balance of the time<br>
      That only blindly I could read you<br>
      But I could read you<br>
      It's like you told me<br>
      Go forward slowly<br>
      It's not a race to the end<br>
      Well you look like yourself<br>
      But you're somebody else<br>
      Only it ain't on the surface<br>
      Well you talk like yourself<br>
      No, I hear someone else though<br>
      Now you're making me nervous<br>
      You were the better part<br>
      Of every bit of beating heart that I had<br>
      Whatever I had<br>
      I finally sat alone<br>
      Pitch black flesh and bone<br>
      Couldn't believe that you were gone</p><br>

      <p>Nobody move, there's blood on the floor<br>
          And I can't find my heart<br>
          Where did it go? Did I leave it in the cold?<br>
          So please give it back, 'cause it's not yours to take<br>
          It must've fell when I lost my mind<br>
          Deep in the cut, drowning in a pain<br>
          Somebody help, 'cause I can't find my way<br>
          Nobody move, nobody move<br>
          Somebody tell me how I'm supposed to feel<br>
          When I'm sitting here knowing this ain't real<br>
          Why in the world would I give my heart to you?<br>
          Just to watch you throw it in the trash<br>
          I've been traveling so long, I don't think I can hold on<br>
          Where were you when I needed you the most?<br>
          Now I'm sitting here with a black hole in my chest<br>
          A heartless, broken mess</p><br>

       <h2 id="phoenix">Phoenix- If I Ever Feel Better</h2>
       <p>Phoenix was conceived in the 1990s when vocalist Thomas Mars, bassist Deck d'Arcy, and guitarist Chris Mazzalai,
         who were all friends in school, started playing together as a "garage band" based out of Mars's house in the suburbs of Paris</p>
       <p>They say an end can be a start<br>
          Feels like I've been buried yet I'm still alive<br>
          It's like a bad day that never ends<br>
          I feel the chaos around me<br>
          A thing I don't try to deny<br>
          I'd better learn to accept that<br>
          There are things in my life I can't control<br>
          They say love ain't nothing but a sore<br>
          I don't even know what love is<br>
          Too many tears have had to fall<br>
          Don't you know I'm so tired of it all<br>
          I have known terror dizzy spells<br>
          Finding out the secrets words won't tell<br>
          Whatever it is it can't be named<br>
          There's a part of my world that's fading away<br>
          You know I don't want to be clever<br>
          To be brilliant or superior<br>
          True like ice, true like fire<br>
          Now I know that a breeze can blow me away<br>
          Now I know there's much more dignity<br>
          In defeat than in the brightest victory<br>
          I'm losing my balance on the tight rope<br>
          Tell me please, tell me please, tell me please...<br>
          If I ever feel better<br>
          Remind me to spend some good time with you<br>
          You can give me your number<br>
          When it's all over I'll let you know</p>

            <p>I know you don't but I<br>
                I know you don't but I still try<br>

                My thunder came and shook him down<br>
                That girl is gone but I<br>
                That girl is gone but I still try<br>

                My body's looking wrong<br>
                Bye bye baby blue<br>
                I wish you could see the wicked truth<br>
                Caught up in a rush, it's killing you<br>
                Screaming at the sun you blow into<br>
                Curled up in a grip when we were us<br>
                Fingers in a fist like you might run<br>
                I settle for a ghost I never knew<br>
                Superparadise I held on to<br>
                But I settle for a ghost</p>
